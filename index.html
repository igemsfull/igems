                <span>About:</span> <br><br>

                IGEMS is the market leader in software for plasma and waterjet cutting machines. The software has a large number of tools for creating a program that controls cutting. <br><br>

                Among the main features of CAD/CAM IGEMS: <br><br>

                 • the ability to expand the system by connecting additional modules; <br>
                 • working with files of different formats: .dxf, .dwg, .cnc, .ttf, .geo, etc.; <br>
                 • library of standard blanks; <br>
                 • the ability to choose between automatic and manual placement of blanks onto a sheet on a 1:1 scale to minimize waste; <br>
                 • possibility of calculating cutting at an angle; <br>
                 • creation of symbols and signs with support for TTF, SHX and CFX with the ability to convert them into vector graphics; <br>
                • maintaining warehouse records, recording material balances and its consumption <br><br>

                <span>Modules:</span> <br><br>

                1. CAD is the main module, working with which is almost identical to working in the AutoCAD environment. AutoCAD users will have no problem learning the new software. <br><br>

                2. NEST – a module that allows you to minimize material consumption and save money. The algorithms of this module collect all the necessary parts on a sheet like a puzzle, trying to fit as many of them on one sheet as possible. The NEST module is available in two levels. Level 1 contains several strategies to minimize waste. Level 2 allows you to expand the capabilities of Level 1. It is indispensable in situations where you need to place many parts of various shapes and sizes on a sheet. <br><br>

                3. Tile maker is designed specifically for working with tiles and stone, allowing you to select the pattern and structure of the stone for floors; a great solution for designers. Based on the ornament of the future mosaic, the mosaic is divided into parts, for each of which you can choose the type of processing. <br><br>

                4. Organizer is a simple and easy to use SQL database for storing parts and related documents. It is possible to configure filters, allowing quick access to the desired part. <br><br>

                5. Floating license – a floating license is a network license from IGEMS installed on a local network. This module is intended for large companies with many employees working with IGEMS software. <br><br>

                6. Data exchange allows you to import files not only in standard DWG and DXF formats, it is possible to convert CNC to CAD, as well as import formats such as: .PS, .EPS, .WMF, .TAG, .PRT, .GEO, . CBF, .ORD, .IGS <br><br>

                7. CAM tools – auxiliary tools for creating, making changes, optimizing parts, allowing you to save time. <br><br>

                8. Sign maker – a module that allows you to convert drawings (.JPG and .BMP) and fonts into CAD geometry. Working with vector graphics and fonts, the ability to write along a curve. <br><br>

                9. 2D CAM – CAM expansion module for flat cutting along a contour, it is possible to configure cutting quality, cutting speed and movement, and type of processing. You can adapt 2D CAM to work with two cutting heads, as well as to work on laser, oxygen, plasma and waterjet cutting machines. <br><br>

                10. AWJ – a special module adapted for waterjet cutting. When cutting with an abrasive liquid jet, to maintain the quality of the cut, it is necessary to reduce the speed at corners and intersections. This module allows you to automatically speed up and slow down cutting based on the geometry of the part, as well as control the supply of abrasive. <br><br>

                11. 5X CAM allows you to make bevels and chamfers of 45 degrees. Supports fixed or variable angle bevels.
